# TODO: interpret the scaly property in matplotlib engine
# TODO: for non-shared axes, have option to position the ticks and labels
#       on different sides of the plot.
#       Either:
#       1. Automatically alternate sides
#       2. Have a property in each individual plot or plotgroup that
#          allows you to manually set the side you want the ticks to be in.
