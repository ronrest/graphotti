# Git conventions

## comment prefixes

- `FEAT:` when the commit adds/removes/changes some functionality of the library
- `FIX:` fixing a bug
- `TODO:` adding a todo
- `REFACTOR:` things like name changes, that do not change the functionality as such
- `DOCS:` adding/removing comments, or actual documentation
- `CHORE:` things like updating library version number, updating gitignore file.
- `TIDY: ` things like adding/removing whitespaces, or non-executable text like separators/decorators to make the code more readable. Also when repositioning the order of chunks of code (where the position makes no difference to the functionality)
